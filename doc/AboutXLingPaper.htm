               <li>2.14.0_3 23 November 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>When an interlinear in an interlinear-text had an exampleHeading, the exampleHeading was not always formatted correctly; in
                        particular, any embedded elements (like object) were ignored.
                     </li>
                     <li>The XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>If one specified  'oblique' in a font-style attribute, the PDF failed to be produced.  This is fixed.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.14.0_2 22 November 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>Fixed: Word/OO output does not use superscript for an endnote number in text when have endnotes (with a publisher style sheet).</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.14.0_1 20 November 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>Added documentation on how to change an abbreviation within text. See section 11.35 "Change a set of abbrRef elements to refer
                        to a different abbreviation" in the user documentation.
                     </li>
                     <li>XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>For a publisher style sheet, if two or more language elements used the same font family and a non-initial one used Graphite,
                              the Graphite indicator would be ignored.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Publisher style sheets:
                        <ul>
                           <li>For a publisher style sheet, if there were multiple authors, one needed to have at least as many authorLayouts as there were
                              authors. Fixed this so that one can use either one set of author/affiliation/emailAddress layouts or multiple sets.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Fix broken way of how the Mac and Linux versions determine if the converter program for Word and Open Office Writer is present.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.14.0 17 November 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>Add emailAddress element to front matter.</li>
                     <li>In chooser for citations, added the date of the work after the author name.</li>
                     <li>Improvements to references (bibliography) information:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Added a "Jump to Work in References" command to make it easier to find entries in the references.</li>
                           <li>Add jIssueNumber to article references.</li>
                           <li>In an article reference, made the jPages or jArticleNumber be optional (with the advent of posting papers on the web, there
                              are now some that do not use either; e.g. see <a href="http://www.und.edu/dept/linguistics/wp/2008.htm">http://www.und.edu/dept/linguistics/wp/2008.htm</a>).
                           </li>
                           <li>Add seriesEd and seriesEdInitials to book and collection references.</li>
                           <li>Add edition element to collection references.</li>
                           <li>Add a way to override default text for dissertation (i.e. 'Ph.D. dissertation').</li>
                           <li>Add a way to override default text for thesis (i.e. 'M.A. thesis').</li>
                           <li>Made it so all reference items (article, book, collection, etc.) can have url, dateAccessed, iso639-3code, and comment elements
                              with the reference item. These were all available before but only at the refWork element.
                           </li>
                           <li>Made reference handling a bit easier in that when one wants to change a book to an article, say, one can now select the book
                              element and then use the replace operation and one will get the usual template content for a new article element.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>New publisher style sheets enhancements:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Ability to override langData, gloss, and interlinear free translation formatting per the style sheet. It also allows inserting
                              text before or after each of these items (e.g. inserting quotes before and after the free translation).
                           </li>
                           <li>Control whether or not a section number appears.</li>
                           <li>Control whether or not the initial paragraph of a section/chapter is indented.</li>
                           <li>Control where 'Ph.D. dissertation' and 'M.A. thesis' appear for dissertation and thesis reference layouts. (Note one must
                              now add a dissertationLabelItem or thesisLabelItem in each reference 'pattern' or there will be a message that the pattern
                              was not found.)
                           </li>
                           <li>Improved process of matching for patterns in reference layouts (it was a bit sloppy before).</li>
                           <li>Improved notification for when a pattern in references was not found. It now tells you what the elements are that were not
                              found.
                           </li>
                           <li>Ability in the references layout section to put url and date accessed layout information under a common grouping (similar
                              to what has been available for location and publisher layout information).
                           </li>
                           <li>Added ability in the references layout section for location/publisher grouping and url/date accessed grouping to include a
                              "missing" item. This greatly reduces the number of patterns needed to describe possible combinations.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Improvements to abbreviations:
                        <ul>
                           <li>For documents with an abbreviations master file that has more than one language, the abbreviation in the display in XXE will
                              now show the abbreviation for the language specified in the abbreviationlang attribute of the lingPaper element.
                           </li>
                           <li>When one adds a second language for an abbreviation (i.e. one inserts an abbrInLang element after an extant abbrInLang element),
                              one can now use the SetReference command to set the language of the abbrInLang element. One can also use the SetReference
                              command to change the language of any other abbrInLang element.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Front and back matter that are to be right-aligned per a publisher style sheet were still coming out left-aligned. Also improved
                              centering.
                           </li>
                           <li>Added XeLaTeXSpecial command of column-formatting to allow one to override default table column formatting description. Note
                              that this will probably only work well for simple tables.
                           </li>
                           <li>Added two XeLaTeXSpecial commands for table cells: border-left and border-right; these add a vertical line to the left or
                              right of the cell, respectively.
                           </li>
                           <li>Fixed handling of tables so that if you use a width attribute in the first row, it will apply to all other rows as well unless
                              the table has cells with colspan or rowspan attributes set.
                           </li>
                           <li>Added check for .svg image files that have an equivalent .pdf form. If so, it will automatically use the .pdf file. This lets
                              us see the image file in XXE. (XeLaTeX cannot format .svg, but it can format .pdf; XXE cannot display .pdf, but it can display
                              .svg).
                           </li>
                           <li>Fixed bug which caused a document to fail to produce PDF output with a style sheet whenever the style sheet forced an appendix
                              title to upper case and the title was to be centered.
                           </li>
                           <li>Fixed a bug in a table where an unwanted horizontal line was output (and also cause the heading material to not show). This
                              could occur when the first cell of a table row was a th element with a rowspan attribute greater than 1.
                           </li>
                           <li>Fixed bug where a br element within a listDefinition would cause it to fail to produce the PDF.</li>
                           <li>Fixed a bug where if a style sheet had a numberLayout for a section definition and that section does not begin a paragraph,
                              the PDF would fail to be produced.
                           </li>
                           <li>Fixed a bug where if a user had specified to use Graphite and also used a percentage-based font size, the Graphite processing
                              failed to occur.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Updated all provided publisher style sheets and XLingPaper "new file" templates to reflect changes in reference handling.</li>
                     <li>Fixed publisher style sheet bugs:
                        <ul>
                           <li>In a paper, if there was an acknowledgement element in the back matter, it was formatted per the front matter acknowledgement
                              of the style sheet, not the back matter acknowledgement information.
                           </li>
                           <li>Removed link to nowhere for iso639-3code elements in references.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Word and Open Office output: fixed bug which caused floats (tablenumbered and figure elements) to be ignored.</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug which failed to associate a publisher style sheet when the file name contained an apostrophe.</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug where fieldNotes references items were not output in the (non-style sheet) RenderX way of producing PDF.</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug for the web page output which showed at the end of the file the name and version of a references style sheet embedded
                        within a publisher style sheet.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug for the web page output which failed to pay attention to the cssSpecial attribute of a td element.</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug for the XSL-FO-based outputs which failed to pay attention to the xsl-foSpecial attribute of a td element.</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug where a refWork containing a citation element in its refTitle would always appear in the list of references, even
                        when that refWork was never cited in the document.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug which failed to format backgroundcolor attribute of language elements.</li>
                     <li>Added ability for indexes to control the text that occurs when there is a "see" or "see also" entry in the index.</li>
                     <li>Improved how the Mac and Linux versions determine if the converter program for Word and Open Office Writer is present.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.13.0 7 September 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>Add landscape element so can get PDF output to switch to a new page, but in landscape mode; the headers and footers remain
                        as they were, but the page content shows up in landscape mode. This works with both the default XeLaTeX way of producing PDF
                        as well as the RenderX way of producing PDF.
                     </li>
                     <li>Enable a way to magnify the contents of a document for a poster. Currently only works with a publisher style sheet and the
                        two ways of producing PDF.
                     </li>
                     <li>Add command to convert selected text into an object element. It uses a keyboard short-cut of Ctrl-F11.</li>
                     <li>Add command to produce Open Office Writer format.</li>
                     <li>XeLaTeX way of producing PDF: 
                        <ul>
                           <li>Fix bug whereby a language ID containing either underscores or hyphens would cause the default PDF to fail.</li>
                           <li>Fix bug whereby a font name containing either underscores or hyphens would cause the publisher style sheet PDF to fail.</li>
                           <li>Fix bug in the default PDF output which still showed a references section when nothing was cited.</li>
                           <li>Since some (Charis SIL) font features require the Graphite renderer capability of XeTeX, added 'Graphite' as a XeLaTeXSpecial
                              attribute value.
                           </li>
                           <li>Fix bug which caused the free translation of a listInterlinear embedded within a table to insist on using most of the width
                              of the page instead of using the width of the interlinear or free translation itself.
                           </li>
                           <li>Fix bug which caused default way of producing PDF fail to produce PDF if a font-family was used in the abbreviations element.</li>
                           <li>Fix bug which caused background color in table headers to be shorter than in table cells.</li>
                           <li>Fix bug which caused the PDF to fail if a publisher style sheet used the "After First Line" option for Interlinear source
                              style.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>RenderX way of producing PDF: make books also have bookmarks in the PDF.</li>
                     <li>A section2 element within a chapterBeforePart element would not correctly display the chapter number.</li>
                     <li>Made inserting a chapterBeforePart element include the secTitle and p elements automatically.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.12.0 26 June 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>Add prose-text element (this is used to enclose paragraphs of vernacular text)</li>
                     <li>Add font information to abbreviations element so can specify an overt small caps font, etc. when formatting abbreviations.
                        The usesmallcaps attribute is now no longer needed but we're keeping it but marking it as deprecated.
                     </li>
                     <li>The part label was not used in PDF output when a publisher style sheet was present.</li>
                     <li>XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Contents indentation was not always correct.</li>
                           <li>Contents for parts were not shown correctly.</li>
                           <li>chapterBeforePart was not being handled correctly with a publisher style sheet.</li>
                           <li>When abbreviations were shown in a table, the table did not break across pages.</li>
                           <li>With a publisher style sheet, left-aligned section headers were indented like a paragraph when they should be on the left
                              margin.
                           </li>
                           <li>When using a publisher style sheet, the title of the paper did not pay attention to any text-transform attributes.</li>
                           <li>When a table with headers was embedded within another table, the PDF failed to be produced.</li>
                           <li>When an example with several listWord items had more langData and gloss items in a non-initial listWord element than the initial
                              listWord element has, the PDF failed to be produced.

                     </li>
                     <li>Always have XeLaTeX way of producing PDF run twice (to make sure tables and contents and bookmarks are correct). This also
                        removed the message about running it for the first time taking longer.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added warning checks for:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Interlinears that are not in an example and appear within a table cell and also have an endnote: most outputs do not produce
                              correct results and the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF fails to produce PDF. We suggest you use some other way of showing the
                              data.
                           </li>
                           <li>Interlinear line elements without either langData or gloss elements that have embedded elements.</li>

                     <li>RenderX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>When using a publisher style sheet, the header and footer information in the style sheet was not used for front matter items
                              (abstract, acknowledgments, contents).
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Correct some inaccuracies in IJAL and IJAL Submission publisher style sheets.</li>
                     <li>Correct some inaccuracies in Language publisher style sheets.</li>
                     <li>The GIAL thesis publisher style sheet had single spacing when it should have had double spacing.</li>
                     <li>Correct some inaccuracies in GIAL thesis publisher style sheets.</li>
                     <li>When using a publisher style sheet, sometimes a thesis reference did not come out correctly (for both ways of producing PDF).</li>

               </li>
               <li>2.11.0 12 May 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>Added figures and numbered tables (i.e. as "floating" objects). Note: this does not work with the Word 2003 output. If a chart
                        (within a figure) or a table (within a numbered table) contains any footnotes, the resulting item will not be a float.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added a listDefinition example</li>
                     <li>Added mediaObject element so can embed sound and movie files (currently only works with RenderX way of producing PDF)</li>
                     <li>Changed table caption alignment default from centered to left.</li>
                     <li>Refine automatically inserted text for sectionRef's textBefore attribute:
                        <ul>
                           <li>While editing, have sectionRef elements automatically show any text before per the value of the textBefore attribute of the
                              sectionRef element and also the related values in the lingPaper element.
                           </li>
                           <li>Remove automatically inserted non-breaking space when a publisher style sheet overrides the text before the sectionRef (e.g.
                              one does not always want a space when one uses the &sect; symbol).
                           </li>
                           <li>Add textBeforeCapitalizedSingularOverride and textBeforeCapitalizedPluralOverride attributes to the sectionRefLayout element
                              in a publisher style sheet.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>For publisher style sheets:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Can control whether footnotes are single-spaced even when the document is space-and-a-half or double spaced (only works for
                              the RenderX way of producing PDF).
                           </li>
                           <li>Can control whether endnotes (i.e. footnotes printed in the back matter instead of on the current page) are single-spaced
                              even when the document is space-and-a-half or double spaced.
                           </li>
                           <li>Can control whether the spacing between references are single-spaced even when the document is space-and-a-half or double
                              spaced.
                           </li>
                           <li>Added a "Use thesis submission style" page layout option. When checked, both odd and even pages will have the same left and
                              right margins; that is, the document will be single-sided.
                           </li>
                           <li>Added check for correct header and footer page information for both books and papers.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed display of chapterBeforePart elements so that they (and embedded sections) use chapter 0 instead of chapter 1.</li>
                     <li>RenderX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>In a book produced via a publisher style sheet, appendices incorrectly used formating information for chapters (not appendices).</li>
                           <li>Fix problem that duplicated some listInterlinear items when an interlinearRef element was present.</li>
                           <li>Fix problem where examples containing either listWord or listSingle elements sometimes repeated an item.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>listSingle items now will wrap if they are too long to fit.</li>
                           <li>The texttransform font attribute can only be applied when there is just text. It will not be applied if there are embedded
                              elements.
                           </li>
                           <li>Added ability to force page break at a section element or at a paragraph.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Fix XeLaTeX way of producing PDF: 
                        <ul>
                           <li>Tables in examples did not always indent the proper amount when the example indent was different than the blockquote indent
                              in a publisher style sheet.
                           </li>
                           <li>If an li element contained text, an example, and then a p or pc element, the p or pc elements were not indented correctly
                              (or may not have appeared at all!).
                           </li>
                           <li>A footnote number appeared in a free translation but the content of the footnote did not appear on the page.</li>
                           <li>Free translations did not always indent the proper amount when the example indent was different than the blockquote indent
                              in a publisher style sheet.
                           </li>
                           <li>When a publisher style sheet used endotes, the content of the endnotes was not correct.</li>
                           <li>When the font-variant attribute was set to be 'small-caps', the font-size was not correct (it was still full size). Now the
                              font size is automatically set to 65% unless there is an overt font-size attribute (in which case the overt font size value
                              is used).
                           </li>
                           <li>The PDF failed to be produced when an abbrRef was embedded in an object that used small-caps.</li>
                           <li>Compensate for characters in image file names that conflict with TeX. Also check for %, $, and ~ in image file names (which
                              will break TeX) and report these to user before processing the PDF.
                           </li>
                           <li>When there were no references, the publisher style sheet method still showed a references section in the table of contents.</li>
                           <li>An example containing a chart which begins with an ordered or unordered list might not allow enough space for the example
                              number.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed definitions to properly show and handle types and embedded keyTerm elements.</li>
                     <li>Table of contents with the Word 2003 output will now be better aligned.</li>
                     <li>The "produce Word 2003" process can now handle .bmp files (if you use the latest version of the XMLmind XSL-FO Converter program).</li>
                     <li>Fix Web page output to distinguish links to multiple instances of preface elements.</li>
                     <li>Fix "Remove (unassociate) a publisher style sheet" to use correct document type info.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.10.0 24 March 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>Created full installers for Mac (OS X 10.4+) and Linux (tested on Ubuntu 8.04, 9.04, and 9.10).</li>
                     <li>Made the "produce Word 2003" process work with the full, GUI-based XMLmind XSL Utility product.</li>
                     <li>Made XeLaTeX way of producing PDF ignore blank p (paragraph) elements just like the web page and RenderX way of producing
                        PDF do. Previously, the XeLaTeX way would show a blank line for every empty paragraph.
                     </li>
                     <li>For publisher style sheet-based PDF output, if a refWork element does not have a matching pattern in the references layout
                        portion of the publisher style sheet, we now output a message in the PDF. Previously, the content of the refWork element was
                        silently left out completely.
                     </li>
                     <li>PDF using publisher style sheet: a dissertation with a url element may not have shown in the output. Similarly for a proceedings
                        element.
                     </li>
                     <li>Allow br element in td, th, langData, and gloss for the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</li>
                     <li>Refined use of zero width spaces in URLs for the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</li>
                     <li>Fixed problem with orphaned section title in RenderX way of producing PDF (when using double spacing).</li>
                     <li>Improved method of changing the default lVernacular and lGloss language IDs. See section 11.27 "Change the lVernacular and
                        lGloss language IDs" in the user documentation.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added warning checks for incomplete href attributes in link elements, src attributes in img elements, and citename and name
                        attributes in refAuthor elements.
                     </li>
                     <li>Producing PDF via XeLaTeX failed when a table cell had the XeLaTeXSpecial attribute containing a valign-fixup value and there
                        was no rowspan
                     </li>
                     <li>Allow zero width spaces in URLs so the PDF formatters can break the URLs at ends of lines.</li>
                     <li>Fix bug in PDF outputs: a section[1-6] element had a type attribute, but it was being ignored.</li>
                     <li>Enhance publisher style sheet output to control whether the hundreds digit in the second part of a page range should be output
                        or not. For example, should 158-183 be output as "158-83" or as "158-183"?
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.9.0 29 January 2010
                  <ul>
                     <li>Add a section in the user documentation on how to produce a talk handout.</li>
                     <li>Add section in user documentation on how to insert a sectionN when in a sectionN+1.</li>
                     <li>Refined the "About XLingPaper" page.</li>
                     <li>In web page output, add extra space between consecutive examples.</li>
                     <li>Refined the Choose Font Dialog:
                        <ul>
                           <li>It now knows about using default values for font-family, font-size, font-style, and font-weight.</li>
                           <li>The font-size can now be a percentage.</li>
                           <li>In fact, the font-size defaults to being a percentage.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Refined the "Associate a publisher style sheet" process to:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Use a regular file chooser dialog (instead of the special one used before).</li>
                           <li>Keep any referenced documents (the old way lost the referencing).</li>
                           <li>Make the path to the publisher style sheet be relative to the document being edited.</li>
                           <li>Check to make the sure the file is indeed a publisher style sheet.</li>
                           <li>Check to make sure the file is actually there.</li>
                           <li>Removed the Shift-F9 keyboard short-cut (this command is not used enough to warrant a keyboard short-cut).</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Added a "Remove (unassociate) a publisher style sheet" command.</li>
                     <li>Refined the checking for missing fonts and/or image files before trying to produce PDF. It now shows a dialog box you can
                        use to quickly find the places where the problems are.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed the 'convert abbreviations in gloss to abbrRefs' commands so 
                        <ul>
                           <li>they will find person numbers (1, 2, or 3) before other abbreviations (such as number or gender);</li>
                           <li>they will also use periods, underscores, semi-colons, colons, backslashes, square brackets and parentheses as delimiters when
                              looking for abbreviations;
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Fixed 'Convert any abbreviations in gloss to abbrRefs' command so it will apply even when there are other elements within
                        the gloss (such as object elements or abbrRef elements).
                     </li>
                     <li>When you overtly save a file, if any of the endnote elements still have just a simple "n" for their id or if any refWork elements
                        still have just a simple "r" for their id, a unique id will now automatically be assigned. You can change these at any time
                        by editing the id attribute in the endnote or refWork element.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added new element: interlinearRefCitation. It can occur anywhere other ref items appear. It refers to an interlinear within
                        an interlinear text included in the document (usually in an appendix). In the output, it displays the short name of the text
                        and the line number in that text of the referred to interlinear.
                     </li>
                     <li>Refine the interlinearRefCitation element to allow control of the presence of the square brackets and the text-name-colon.
                        Also have the interlinearRefCitation appear in XXE like it will in the output.
                     </li>
                     <li>Have the 'Insert and then Set Reference' command include the interlinearRefCitation element.</li>
                     <li>Fix bug which made the Set Reference chooser dialog show garbage if the material that it was trying to show contained a double
                        quote.
                     </li>
                     <li>Made the installer so that XXE will automatically show the Validity tool upon save if there are any errors/warnings.</li>
                     <li>Fixed bug which allowed a citation occurring inside a comment element to cause an entry to show in the references.</li>
                     <li>Add a semantic integrity check for long tables that do not have the makings of a header.</li>
                     <li>Fix a bug: an example reference to an example within an endnote/footnote did not use the roman numeral for the example it
                        referred to.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed some bugs in the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Examples in tables would fail to produce the PDF.</li>
                           <li>free elements did not pay attention to font information (other than font-family).</li>
                           <li>If a date or presentedAt element ended in a br element, the PDF failed to be produced.</li>
                           <li>If a table with lines was embedded in another table with lines, the PDF failed to be produced.</li>
                           <li>If a file name contained spaces, it did not always correctly recognize the first time the file was being processed.</li>
                           <li>If the file name contained parentheses, the process to produce PDF might hang.</li>
                           <li>If the file name contained non-ASCII characters, the process to produce PDF might fail.</li>
                           <li>If a publisher style sheet said an item was to start on an odd page and also that the item should space down from the top,
                              it did not always space down.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed some bugs with the RenderX way of producing PDF:
                        <ul>
                           <li>An empty colspan attribute in a table cell would prevent the PDF from being produced.</li>
                           <li>An empty rowspan attribute in a table cell would prevent the PDF from being produced.</li>
                           <li>An initial table row that began with some th elements but also had some td elements would prevent the PDF from being produced.</li>
                           <li>Showing the list of abbreviations as a table when there were no abbreviations to show would prevent the PDF from being produced.</li>
                           <li>No longer try to use an xsl-foSpecial attribute that does not have an equal sign in it.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.8.0 18 December 2009
                  <ul>
                     <li>Added an "About XLingPaper" page (In XLingPaper menu item).</li>
                     <li>Added a command to convert text material in a gloss to their corresponding abbreviation (i.e. abbrRef elements).</li>
                     <li>Enhanced the "Convert interlinear line to wrd elements" command to also automatically convert abbreviations to abbrRef elements
                        (in gloss elements only, and only when one has abbreviations).
                     </li>
                     <li>Added more integrity checks for "semantic" conditions (such as incorrect number of langData elements within a line element).</li>
                     <li>Made the Produce Word Document work with the newly released version of the XMLmind XSL-FO Converter (version 4.3.2).</li>
                     <li>Allow an abbreviation reference (abbrRef element) to appear within a genericRef element and also within an object element.</li>
                     <li>Fix a bug where if you use the mouse to set an exampleRef, sometimes the output would not have the example number. The fix
                        occurs whenever you save your file.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed bug in web transform which failed to show a background color in a table cell when the td or th element referred to a
                        type element that had the background color.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added align attribute to the table element. It has values of "left", "center", and "right". The default is "left". This attribute
                        makes no difference for the RenderX way of producing PDF (because RenderX has no way to implement it). It only works in tables
                        which are not in examples.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added two special attributes for the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF to add a (horizontal) line before and/or after a row in
                        a table. To use this, in a tr element, add 'linebefore' or 'lineafter' to the XeLaTeXSpecial attribute.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed some bugs in the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF: 
                        <ul>
                           <li>Superscript and subscript type elements were missing the XeLaTeXSpecial attributes (the words superscript and subscript, respectively)
                              so superscript and subscript did not work.
                           </li>
                           <li>Added needed space between listInterlinears and embedded (or continuation) interlinear lines.</li>
                           <li>There was no way to add an underline via a type element. Fixed it by adding the key word underline to XeLaTeXSpecial).</li>
                           <li>A table containing a cell with both a rowspan and colspan did not properly align some following cells.</li>
                           <li>A table containing a cell with both a rowspan and colspan did not properly center the content if valign='middle'.</li>
                           <li>For table cells (td and th), added ability to set XeLaTeXSpecial attribute valign-fixup to fine-tune the vertical alignment
                              when needed (e.g. valign-fixup='-1.25ex').
                           </li>
                           <li>A table containing a cell with a rowspan and a width attribute did not pay attention to the width attribute.</li>
                           <li>A table containing multiple cells with a rowspan did not always properly align the columns.</li>
                           <li>A table containing a cell with both a colspan and a width in the first row produced wrong results.</li>
                           <li>When using a publisher style sheet where the interlinear source is to appear after the first line, the PDF failed to be produced.</li>
                           <li>In an interlinear, when a free element was followed by a lineGroup element, it did not always format correctly.</li>
                           <li>Embedded lists did not always align properly.</li>
                           <li>An endnote within a list would use the indent of the list instead of starting at the left edge.</li>
                           <li>When an abbrRef element was within either a wrd element or a gloss element, any font attributes of the wrd or gloss element
                              were not applying to the content of the abbreviation.
                           </li>
                           <li>When using a publisher style sheet and that style sheet did not use special formatting for a section number, there was no
                              space between the section number and the section title.
                           </li>
                           <li>When a line element had multiple gloss elements or multiple langData elements, the processing could fail.</li>
                           <li>When a table cell (td or th element) had a backgroundcolor attribute set to 0, no PDF would be produced.</li>
                           <li>An abbrRef element always used the default font even when it was within an object or a gloss element that had a different
                              font.
                           </li>
                           <li>If one has a graphic file name containing an apostrophe and that file was not found, no PDF would be produced (and no warning
                              message either!).
                           </li>
                           <li>When an endnote within a table cell had a paragraph followed by a table, sometimes no PDF would be produced.</li>
                           <li>A long ordered list might fail to produce the PDF.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed some bugs in the RenderX way of producing PDF output:
                        <ul>
                           <li>A short endnote would be incorrectly formatted justified across the width of the page whenever the endnote was within a free
                              translation that was part of an interlinear that had an interlinearSource element.
                           </li>
                           <li>If one was showing abbreviations as a table and there were no abbreviations in the file, the PDF failed to be produced.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed some bugs in both PDF output formats:
                        <ul>
                           <li>An endnote element within a langData (or gloss) element would use the font information of the langData element instead of
                              the default font information.
                           </li>
                           <li>When using a publisher style sheet with only one author description and the paper/book had multiple authors, the second and
                              beyond authors did not format per the author description.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Improved web page output:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Increased spacing between an exampleHeader and a table.</li>
                           <li>Increased spacing between listInterlinears.</li>
                           <li>Increased spacing between nested interlinears.</li>
                           <li>Make abbrRef elements use color and font attributes of their enclosing gloss and object elements. No underline is normally
                              shown, even though it is still a link.
                           </li>
                           <li>If a dissertation or thesis reference had an institution, the institution name was not followed by a period. This is fixed.</li>
                           <li>When viewed in Internet Explorer, sometimes words in small-caps would be raised a bit higher than the rest of the line (in
                              interlinear). Made a change to try and improve this.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.7.2 12 October 2009
                  <ul>
                     <li>Improved vertical spacing around examples in the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</li>
                     <li>Significantly Improved vertical spacing around titles, chapters, and section titles in the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</li>
                     <li>Removed unnecessary message which popped up when changing language font information.</li>
                     <li>Made SIL International publisher style sheets use correct font size and style in headers and footers.</li>
                     <li>Fixed bug which failed to show multiple glossaries in both the web page output and also in the "canned" RenderX way of producing
                        PDF.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed bugs that made the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF fail whenever a publisher style sheet had
                        <ul>
                           <li>sections that began a paragraph<br></br></li>
                           <li>interlinear source show underneath the free translation (and a given interlinear did not have any interlinear source element)</li>
                           <li>an abstract (and the abstract was indented)</li>
                           <li>special font formatting for sectionRef elements</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Slightly modified the default IJAL publisher style sheets and the Language publisher style sheet.</li>
                     <li>Made the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF use "left justified" in table cells where the width attribute was set (it was still
                        justifying the content which caused gaps to appear).
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed bugs that made the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF via a book publisher style sheet 
                        <ul>
                           <li>not always have the hyperlink to frontmatter table of contents items be on the correct page</li>
                           <li>not have the hyperlink to the references be on the correct page</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.7.1 30-September 2009
                  <ul>
                     <li>Improved the listing of possible elements to insert (that is, the list that shows up in the Element Editor). Now short element
                        names (e.g. "pc") also have a version that includes a fuller description (e.g. "pc(paragraph_continuation)").
                     </li>
                     <li>Improved the notification process for when the file you are trying to produce (PDF, Word, or web page) is being used by another
                        program. It no longer has an odd error message, just a meaningful dialog box.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug that made the "Produce PDF" process not work if the document was on a drive other than C:.</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug that made the "Produce PDF" process not work if the document was located on the root or top directory of a drive.</li>
                     <li>Fixed the "Produce PDF" process to now work if your computer did not already have certain system files (msvcp71.dll and msvcr71.dll).</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug in the XeLaTeX way of producing a PDF file that caused it to fail if an interlinear had two lineGroup elements
                        in a row.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug that incorrectly aligned a second free translation within an interlinear if one had a sequence of "lineGroup,
                        free, lineGroup, free" in that interlinear.
                     </li>
                     <li>Made the included IJAL submission publisher style sheet show contents, block quotes, examples, references, and table be single
                        spaced while the rest is double spaced.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.7.0 18-September 2009
                  <ul>
                     <li>Made to work on computers running Unix and Mac (OS X) operating systems (Unix tested only on Ubuntu 8.4.0 and 9.4.0).</li>
                     <li>Unix and Mac versions do not yet work with the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF output. You will need to use the RenderX way.</li>
                     <li>When you overtly save a file, if any of the examples still have just a simple "x" for their id, a unique id will now automatically
                        be assigned. You can change these at any time by editing the id attribute in the example.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed RenderX PDF to pay attention to singlespace options when the document is double or space-and-half (via a style sheet).</li>
                     <li>Fixed RenderX PDF to properly format more than one preface in a book.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.6.0 13-August-2009
                  <ul>
                     <li>Created an installation package to make installation much, much simpler.</li>
                     <li>This package includes a second, new way to produce PDF output; see section 11.17 'Produce a PDF Version' in the user documentation
                        file.
                     </li>
                     <li>It now will tell you what to do when you try to produce a PDF file (via the RenderX XEP tool) and you do not yet have that
                        tool installed.
                     </li>
                     <li>It will now tell you what to do when you try to produce a Word 2003 document and you do not yet have the XMLmind XSL-FO Converter
                        tool installed.
                     </li>
                     <li>It will now automatically show a PDF or Word file after it has been produced.</li>
                     <li>Refined the "grammar" for table rows. It used to allow any combination of td (regular cell) elements and th (header) elements.
                        Now a table row is more restrictive:
                        <ul>
                           <li>The entire row must have only th elements or</li>
                           <li>The entire row must have only td elements or</li>
                           <li>The beginning (left) of the row can have one or more th elements followed by all td elements.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>The reason for this change is that table headers should only be at the top or along the left side. The rows at the top will
                        get carried over to the next page when a long table is split across page boundaries. To fix a table you may have that is now
                        considered to be ill-formed, do this:
                        <ul>
                           <li>For each bad th element in the table, click on the th element in the XPath Bar, click the Convert icon in the Edit Pane and
                              choose td. This will keep the content of the cell whle changing it from th to td.
                           </li>
                           <li>If you had used a th element in order to make the cell content come out bold, select the cell content and then click on the
                              Convert icon in the Edit pane and choose object. Then press F11 and choose a type that produces bold.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>There is a new menu item that lets you convert .svg files to .pdf files (since the new way of producing PDF files does not
                        handle .svg files, but does handle embedded .pdf files).
                     </li>
                     <li>Let a glossary element have a type attribute.</li>
                     <li>Allow type attributes in back matter element titles.</li>
                     <li>Fix a bug in handling chapters via a publisher style sheet.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.5.1 21-May-2009
                  <ul>
                     <li>Made the langData, gloss, object, and wrd elements show in XXE as they will appear in the output. This is now possible because
                        of a bug fix in XXE version 4.3.0.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fix bug in "Convert interlinear line to wrd elements" process.</li>
                     <li>The book element no longer requires location and publisher. These are now optional.</li>
                     <li>Fix bug in handling an endnote in a section title when producing the table of contents in web page output.</li>

                     <li>Improve PDF "bookmark" formatting in PDF output.</li>
                     <li>Added "variantTypes" to type attribute of the item element</li>
                     <li>Added width attribute to both td and th elements.</li>
                     <li>Added background color attribute to many elements</li>
                     <li>Added bVol and seriesItem elements to collectionLayout so these can show in output using a stylesheet.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.5.0 23-Feb-2009
                  <ul>
                     <li>Make work (partly) on a Mac. PDF output does not work yet.</li>
                     <li>Fix "Convert interlinear line to wrd elements" command to use the lang attribute of the original langData or gloss element
                        for all the resulting wrd elements (and not just the last one)
                     </li>

                     <li>Fix bug in formatting multiple glossary elements in a paper associated with a stylesheet.</li>
                     <li>Fix bug in formatting interlinear text reference in a paper associated with a stylesheet</li>
                     <li>Fix bug in formatting appendix letter in a paper associated with a stylesheet</li>
                     <li>Fix bug in formatting section number when there is only one section in a paper associated with a stylesheet</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.4.0 24-January-2009
                  <ul>
                     <li>Make work with XMLmind XML Editor (XXE) version 4.2.0 or earlier</li>
                     <li>Had to stop showing the langData, gloss, and object elements as they will appear in the output. It made XXE load large files
                        extremely slowly. Plans are to try a different way to achieve this that does not slow down XXE.
                     </li>
                     <li>Allow table elements (including rows and cells) to have a background color attribute</li>
                     <li>Reworked how promote and demote sections was done since sometimes it failed to run</li>
                     <li>Allow interlinearSource element in a listInterlinear</li>
                     <li>Added fieldNotes as a new kind of refWork element</li>
                     <li>In PDF output, if there are no chapters and there is but one section1 (with no subsections), no section number is produced</li>
                     <li>Fixed bug that incorrectly indented a second free translation line in an interlinear when the second line was for a different
                        language than the first line
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed bug with interlinearRef that sometimes showed more than one instance of the interlinear</li>
                     <li>Some improvements to publisher stylesheet information and handling</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.3.0 7-October-2008
                  <ul>
                     <li>The langData, gloss, and object elements now display in the XXE editor as they will appear in the output. They used to show
                        in a pre-canned color, using a generic font. Now they use the appropriate font, color, size, italic, bold, etc.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added the ability to gloss language data using a standard set of abbreviations. Just like one can create and maintain a master
                        references list, now one can do the same for abbreviations. XLingPaper also creates a hyperlink between the abbreviation in
                        the gloss and the abbreviation where it is defined. See section 4.6 in the user documentation.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added ability for examples to have a heading (or label or description or whatever you want to call it). See section 5.8 iin
                        the user documentation.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added a shorter way to insert reference elements and assign them to their value (e.g. sectionRef, exampleRef, citation, object,
                        etc.). See section 12.9 in the user documentation.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added a genericTarget element so one can use the genericRef element to create a hyperlink to almost any place in the document.
                        See footnote [37] in section 10.2 in the user documentation.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added a book volume number element (bVol) for references. See section 4.5.2 in the user documentation.</li>
                     <li>Removed the requirement that a collection have an editor (collEd element). See section 4.5.3 in the user documentation.</li>
                     <li>Added a way to control the text that occurs before a sectionRef (some publications like to use the &sect; symbol while others do
                        not). See section 3.3.1 in the user documentation.
                     </li>
                     <li>The interlinear free translation element can now be associated with a language.</li>
                     <li>Added the ability to include ISO 639-3 codes to a refWork element to indicate which languages the work is about. See section
                        4.5 in the user documentation.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added a way to have the ISO 639-3 code appear in an interlinear example (this is an undocumented ability: set the showiso639-3codeininterlinear
                        attribute to 'yes' in the lingPaper element).
                     </li>
                     <li>Added start-up documents for languages and for types, so one can maintain a master list of these, if one so wishes.</li>
                     <li>Improved the way section numbering shows in Appendices within the XMLmind XML Editor.</li>
                     <li>Fixed "l_free" element templates to show up in embedded places as well as at the example level.</li>
                     <li>Fixed the webpage transform to better handle list interlinears, especially in endnotes (where the old way would cause all
                        following endnotes to place the endnote text on a separate line from the number).
                     </li>
                     <li>Added a number of improvements for publisher style sheets, including:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Added ability to create PDF bookmarks in a styled PDF output.</li>
                           <li>Improved appendix layout</li>
                           <li>Better control over table of contents</li>
                           <li>Added ability to control hyperlink color and underline for individual link elements</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.2.0 12-May-2008
                  <ul>
                     <li>Added interlinearRef element. One uses this in an example to refer to a portion of an interlinear text (which is probably
                        in an appendix). When formatted for output, the interlinear portion is shown in the example along with a link to the portion
                        in the interlinear-text proper.
                     </li>
                     <li>Allow one to put examples in the cells of a (non-example) table. This allows one to put small width examples side-by-side.</li>
                     <li>Added a menu option to automatically convert space-separated interlinear lines to "wrd" element lines. One can now type or
                        copy-and-paste interlinear, use this menu option, and then highlight portions of the interlinear as appropriate to the context
                        of your discussion.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added new element templates for tables with both header rows and an initial header column</li>
                     <li>Added new element templates for interlinear that is just language data and free translation.</li>
                     <li>Added a type attribute to the appendix element so one may now do special formatting for an appendix like one can do for part,
                        chapter, section1, section2, etc. elements.
                     </li>
                     <li>Added a period after the appendix letter in the standard web page and PDF transforms.</li>
                     <li>For PDF produced via a publisher style sheet, added a way to insert some vertical space before a main section in the table
                        of contents.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug which failed to show (within the XMLmind XML Editor) the textref information in a listInterlinear (it was showing
                        fine in a regular interlinear).
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug which failed to show (within the XMLmind XML Editor) a header cell's align attribute.</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug in the PDF output which failed to properly span rows in a table.</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug in the PDF output which failed to properly pay attention to a table cell's valign attribute..</li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug in the publisher style sheet PDF output which caused the transform to abort if one had glossaryLayout information.
                        It now formats the glossary properly.
                     </li>
                     <li>Fixed a bug in the publisher style sheet PDF output: when using paperAuthor for a header or footer in a style sheet when there
                        were 2 or more authors, it used to merely place one author after the other without any intervening space or punctuation. Now
                        it creates a list: it inserts " and " before the last one and inserts ", " between any other two authors.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.1.0 14-Mar-2008
                  <ul>
                     <li>Added capability to relatively easily split portions of a section into sub-sections (i.e. demote the portions).</li>
                     <li>Made a Word macro be available to adjust example spacing problems in the Word 2003 output.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.0.1 10-Mar-2008: 
                  <ul>
                     <li>Fix bug in web page transform which caused some publisher style sheet information to appear at the bottom of the page</li>
                     <li>Fix bug in handling of paperAuthor in headers or footers (came out stretched across the header)</li>
                     <li>Add emphasis type to all new document templates.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.0.0 05-Feb-2008: 
                  <ul>
                     <li>Added publisher style sheets</li>
                     <li>Added shortAuthor (shortened version of author(s) for headers)</li>
                     <li>Allow an endnote in an author element</li>
                     <li>Allow CSS and XSL-FO special attributes on blockquote, chart, dl, example, ol, p, pc, tree, and ul elements.</li>
                     <li>Allow a journal article number</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>1.12.2 13-Sep-2007: change name to XLingPaper</li>
               <li>1.12.1 27-Aug-2007
                  <ul>
                     <li>Fixed how a copied interlinear example shows within a &lt;listInterlinear&gt; element.</li>
                     <li>Made a listInterlinear also be able to show where the interlinear example came from</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>1.12.0 23-Aug-2007
                  <ul>
                     <li>Added a definition type of example, a definition element, and a keyTerm element.</li>
                     <li>Added interlinear text using word-aligned types of interlinear.</li>
                     <li>Added a way to indicate where an interlinear example came from</li>
                     <li>Allow automatic referencing from an interlinear example to an interlinear line within an included interlinear text.</li>
                     <li>Added a note type for the item element</li>
                     <li>Added some page control for a table (only applicable for PDF output)</li>
